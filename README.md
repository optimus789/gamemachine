# Game Machine
It provides a competitive and fun experience while using blockchain and NFTs to create a meaningful use case. Both the games provide a gaming experience with good sound effects and also you can earn some extra perks by burning your NFTs. A simple user interface makes it more entertaining. This project focuses on the utilities of the NFTs in a simple game. 
### Clone the repo and do the following steps

```
% npm i
% npm run start:dev
```

### How it's made
It is made using the Neon Blockchain, IPFS, Tableland and EthersJs. Perks like speed boosters for Crypto Chicken Run and score multiplier for Symbals are being implemented through burning. We have used expressJS as backend and simple HTML/CSS and Js in the frontend. Stored the blockchain data like scores and levels on Tableland.

Our motive behind this was to develop a conversion engine that will be provided as a service to web2 games and its developer and they would be able to easily implement web3 features in their games.
